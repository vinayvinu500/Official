# Project-Title: Coding Platform with AI Hints

# Problem-Statement: 
- build a web application like Hackerrank or Leetcode platform where on the lefthand-side we have description (problem) along with an example 
- on the righthand-side we have coding interface where the user can type and submit the code
- bottom-right below we do have two sections "Test" or "Hints"
- "Test" will be testing the code based on the criteria given aka test-cases 
- "Hints" will be generated or suggest or improve the existing code  

# Why FastAPI as a service
Asynchronous Support: This is crucial for a coding platform that needs to handle potentially expensive I/O operations efficiently.
Performance: FastAPI's performance benefits can be critical as your platform scales and needs to handle multiple simultaneous requests.
Ease of Development: FastAPI's automatic documentation and validation can significantly speed up development and testing.

# Coding Editor
- The Monaco Editor offers a state-of-the-art experience with features closest to desktop IDEs, 
- which can be highly appealing to users familiar with Visual Studio Code. 
- Its support for IntelliSense and code suggestions might also aid in the hinting process, potentially integrating with your AI hint system.

# Engine
- Docker containers are a robust choice for safely executing user code. 
- They provide a good balance between security, resource control, and scalability. 
- You can implement a microservices architecture where each code execution request spins up a Docker container in a secure, isolated environment. 
- This setup can be automated and scaled using orchestration tools like Kubernetes.
