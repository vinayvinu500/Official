by the way, I have a web application build on top of fastapi as a server where the routes to sql coding platform with AI hints where /question/1 route will be going on a page where the left-hand side will be description and database_schema top 5 rows and on the right hand side we do have ace-editor with two buttons Test will test the code which the user has wrote the query inside the ace-editor and beside to that test button there is a hints button which generate hints based on the user query to assist 

before to that there is a another two or more routes such as create-question/ and questions-list/ where we will be able to create questions and will show the list of questions which are created in the mysql database respectively

in the create-question/ route we do have test and submit where user can create the database_schema and sample_solution which will be tested in the mysql database and after that user can able to click on submit to store the database_schema in the local file storage in the Sessions/Schemas/ folder and remaining components such as title, file_name (for the database_schema), user_query (which is the default of --write your query below message or else we can hardcode the syntax for the user), sample_solution (which is the actual code) and all of these components are stored in the sqlite database through sqlalchemy orm model 

whereas, i have ensured the login system where we used jwt token with a period of 30mins login time which will be created once the user has been logged in or signup through localhost:8000/ route 

now coming on to new task which i'm working on is the question creation through automatically where in the backend we will be using gpt model to generate questions and then wanted to check the questions whether there is a mistake in the questions from the llm, where the i have a html template which will collects the components such as which language, number of questions, topic, difficulty_level based on the request from the user i have created the
